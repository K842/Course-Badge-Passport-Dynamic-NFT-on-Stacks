 Project Title
Instructor DAO Governance Tools for School Faculty

📝 Project Description
This smart contract is built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. It provides essential governance tools for educational institutions where school instructors and faculty members can collectively make decisions through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

The initial contract includes two core functionalities:

Propose a New Policy: Faculty members can submit a proposal (like new course approvals, schedule changes, etc.).

Vote on a Proposal: Faculty members can vote to approve or reject proposals. A majority vote determines the proposal's outcome.

🌍 Project Vision
We envision a decentralized, transparent governance system for schools and universities, where faculty decisions are made collaboratively without centralized authority. This promotes fairness, transparency, and collective ownership over institutional decisions.

The DAO approach ensures that every faculty member has a voice in shaping the institution’s policies — from curriculum design to operational improvements.

🚀 Future Scope
✅ Add quorum and deadline for proposals

✅ Role-based access (faculty, admin, observers)

✅ Integration with NFT-based identity (verifiable credentials for instructors)

✅ Proposal history and version control

✅ UI dashboard for voting and proposals using React + Hiro Wallet

✅ Stack token reward system for active voters

📜 Contract Address
Note: Replace with your actual deployed address once deployed on the Stacks testnet/mainnet
